    description: |
      We need to implement an automated system to generate branches for each issue following a specific naming convention.

      The branch naming convention should be:
      - `<type>/<issue-number>-<short-description>`
      - Where `<type>` can be one of: `feature`, `bugfix`, `improvement`, or `docs`.
      - `<short-description>` should be a lowercase, hyphen-separated version of the issue title.

      **Example**:
      - Issue Title: "Improve login functionality"
      - Generated Branch Name: `feature/{{ issue_number }}-improve-login-functionality`

      **Acceptance Criteria**:
      - Branch name should follow the naming convention.
      - The system should be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline and trigger when a new issue is created.
      - A comment should be posted on the issue with the name of the auto-generated branch.
