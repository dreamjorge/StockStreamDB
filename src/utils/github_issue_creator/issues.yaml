    title: "Create Unit Tests for GitHub Issue Creator Script"
    description: |
      We need to create unit tests for the GitHub issue creation script to ensure its reliability and correctness.
      
      The tests should cover:
      - Label creation and updates
      - Milestone creation and updates
      - Issue creation and updates
      - Rate limit checks
      - Error handling for label and milestone creation failures
      - Validation of environment variables (like GitHub tokens)
      
      **Acceptance Criteria**:
      - Unit tests should be written using pytest.
      - Mock external API calls to GitHub to avoid real network requests.
      - Ensure high code coverage, aiming for at least 80%.
